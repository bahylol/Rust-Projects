This project showcases the implementation of a cryptographic commitment scheme designed for managing Bobcoin cryptocurrency (an imaginary cryptocurrency). The primary objective is to maintain the integrity and transparency of the ledger, enabling clients to verify the correctness of their account balances without sacrificing privacy. Key components of the project encompass the implementation of three fundamental structures: SumCommitment, ExclusiveAllotmentProof, and MerkleTree, ultimately culminating in the creation of a Merkle sum tree. The project places significant emphasis on code readability, quality, and documentation, aiming to provide clear and comprehensive insights into the employed cryptographic protocols.
