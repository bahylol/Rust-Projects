This project showcases the development of a private inventory query service for a Tiny-Kiosk franchise utilizing Full Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) technology. The service empowers customers to inquire about stock quantities for items while ensuring the confidentiality of the specific item codes they're interested in. The project encompasses the implementation of a method designed to return ciphertext representing the quantity in stock for a given item code. Input parameters for this method include a ServerKey instance for homomorphic computation, a ciphertext representing the queried item code, and a plaintext list containing all (item, amount) pairs within the inventory.
